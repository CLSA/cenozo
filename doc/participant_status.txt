Participant status is determined by 4 entities: exclusion, hold, trace and proxy.  A participant may belong to a hold, trace and proxy simultaneously, but participant status is determined by evaluating all of these entities in the following order:

  If the participant is excluded from enrollment their status is "not enrolled",
  otherwise, if the participant is in a final hold their status is determined by the hold,
  otherwise, if the participant is in a trace their status is determined by the trace,
  otherwise, if the participant is in any other type of hold their status is determined by the hold,
  otherwise, if the participant is in a proxy their status is determined by the proxy
  otherwise, the participant's status is "active"

New holds and proxies are restricted by the following rules:

1) When a participant's status is "not enrolled", holds and proxies may not be changed.
2) When a participant's status is a "final hold", only final and empty holds may be used and only by tier 3 roles.
